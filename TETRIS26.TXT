Hi,

This is my first 2600 program, a clone of Tetris. I wrote this using DASM
to assemble the code and PC Atari 1.5 to test it. Use the joystick to move
the block and the fire button to rotate it.	I don't know what the speed is
like on a real VCS as I'm using a 486DX25 to test the code.
There's currently no sound ( no soundcard ) and I've tried to keep it all
under 2k.

Feel free to do anything you like with this code, I only wrote it to pass
away a few days. If you have any comments feel free to Email me at:

Cheers,

CJH.
